Designed as a project that would track existing and upcoming video games with
their basic information, with ratings, sales statistics, and a user system that
would foster a community sharing interests in various games.  

All documentation can be found in the doc/ directory, Java object source code 
in the src/ directory, and JSP views and other web items in the war/ directory.

A working example site can be viewed at http://leetcode.homeip.net/gamenwatch
