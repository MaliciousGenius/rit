Systems Programming I 
Q16 Assembler

Unfortunately, between having two other project-heavy courses this quarter,
(OS1 and my SE Senior Project), poor time keeping on my part, and a bunch of
frustrations and setbacks when dealing with the x86 assembly, I have not been
able to complete the project due to having run out of time to work on it.

I take full blaim as the cause for this, as I have worked on assembly programs
in other dialects in my previous courses at RIT, and had not expected things to
take quite as long to implement as it seems that it does in Intel land.

I've completed as much of it as I could given the time and constraints I had,
and I hope that you might be merciful enough to look at what I do have and
perhaps award at least partial credit.

Thank you.
