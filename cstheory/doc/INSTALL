Building Automata from source code:

  The Automata project should be compilable on any POSIX-compatible system
  with the standard GNU C++ compiler and toolchain.  It can be built using the
  GNU make program.  Replace 'x.x' with the version of Automata that you have.
  On some Unix systems, you may need to substitute gmake for the make command:

      gunzip automata-x.x.tgz
      tar xf automata-x.x.tar
      cd automata-x.x
      make
      
Running Automata from source build:

  After extracting and compiling, you can immediatly run the Automata binary:

      ./automata

  For more information, please look to the README file, section 1.1.
