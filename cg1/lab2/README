Implement basic 2D drawing routines using a provided setPixel() function in 
place of OpenGL calls.  This is a really broken implementation, but it 
should compile and run perfectly fine.

Written for use on most Linux or Unix variants using FreeGLUT3 (or similar).  
Type the following command to compile, link, and execute all tests:

    make test

Enjoy.
