    1.Compile the code using "gmakemake > Makefile" and "gmake". There
      should be no problems thus far. Now, try to run the code. What
      error message did you get?

      Abort (core dumped)

    2.You should get some output and be brought back to the
      prompt. What output did you get?

      Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
      0xff21f008 in _libc_kill () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
 

    3.You should notice that the output tells you where the program
      stopped. Where did the program fail?

      failed in _libc_kill()

    4.This indicates that a library method encountered trouble but
      this is not too useful. Another piece of useful information is
      to see where the line that fails is being called from. To get
      this information type where. What is the output that you see? In
      what method does the program fail?

      #0  0xff21f008 in _libc_kill () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
      #1  0xff1b5c80 in abort () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
      #2  0xff3619c8 in ?? () from /usr/local/gnu/lib/libstdc++.so.5
      #3  0xff361a00 in ?? () from /usr/local/gnu/lib/libstdc++.so.5
      #4  0xff361b70 in ?? () from /usr/local/gnu/lib/libstdc++.so.5
      #5  0xff361dac in ?? () from /usr/local/gnu/lib/libstdc++.so.5
      #6  0xff361e8c in ?? () from /usr/local/gnu/lib/libstdc++.so.5
     #7  0x00011a14 in StudentCounter (this=0xffbfeec8) at StudentCounter.cpp:27
      #8  0x00011184 in main () at lab5.cpp:24

      failed inside the default constructz0r

    5.From the information provided it seems that there is a problem
      with the creation of the personArray Lets look at the current
      value of currentMax. To do this type display currentMax. You
      notice the error message "No symbol "currentMax" in current
      context." We need to set the current frame to the frame where
      currentMax is located. This is the frame for
      StudentCounter::StudentCounter(). We can get there by typing the
      command "up" several times until we get to the proper frame or
      we can set the current frame by typing "frame 7". The command
      "up" makes the caller of the current frame the current
      frame. There is also a command "down" that makes the frame
      called from the current frame the current frame. Typing "info
      frame" types out information about the current frame and typing
      "display *this" will type out the value of the 'this'
      object. The command "display" can also type out the value of
      variables visible in the current frame. What is the current
      value of the instance variable currentMax?

      currentMax is undefined at that point in the process

    6.Try to run code again. What error do you get? 

      Segmentation Fault (core dumped)

    7.By clicking on "up" twice you can display where (in non-library
      code) the error occured. Whenever the current frame has source
      code available it is displayed in the top window with an arrow
      pointing to the current line. What line of code is it (in
      Student::operator=(Student const &) )? And what line called
      this?

      line 46 in StudentCounter.cpp called by
      addPerson method line 60

    8.What is the value of numPeople? 

      value is -1 

    9.Now what is the error? Now there is an error in the bubble sort
      routine. Find the frame where i and j are located and print
      their values and the value of numPeople.  Are both i and j
      within bounds of the personArray? You should notice that i is
      out of bounds and that both loops have an incorrect termination
      condition. Fix both loops and the code should work!

      Segmentation Fault (core dumped)
    
      i = 30, out of bounds of the array
      j = 0
