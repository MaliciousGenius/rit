Welcome to the Mastermind program!
Let us see if you can guess my secret number!

  Enter a series of 4-digit guesses, with no repeated digits.

  The score for each guess will be two numbers.

  The first number indicates the number of correct digits
        that are also in the correct position.
  The second number indicates the number of other correct digits
	but which are not in the correct position.

  For example, if my secret number is 0796, and your guess is 2690,
	your score would be ( 1 2 ).

  Obviously, a score of ( 4 0 ) wins the game.

  To quit the program in the middle, type "quit"

Good luck!
