    1.Try to recompile the code, including the new code for the
      NumberPair class. If you type gmake this will happen
      automatically, because gmake notices that NumberPair.h has
      changed and the Makefile specifies that certain other code files
      depend on that file. You will notice that the C++ compiler gives
      you an error message. Write down the error message, and explain
      why you think you got it.

In file included from NumberToGuess.h:29,
                 from mastermind.cpp:17:
NumberPair.h:29: error: redefinition of `class NumberPair'
NumberPair.h:29: error: previous definition of `class NumberPair'
*** Error code 1

c++ expects the class to be defined in order to prevent multiple
classes being defined with the same names

    2.Try to recompile the code, including the new code for the
      NumberPair class. What error message do you get? Why? What do
      you think is happening?

NumberPair.cpp:29: error: prototype for `int NumberPair::getFirst()' does not 
   match any in class `NumberPair'
NumberPair.h:49: error: candidate is: int NumberPair::getFirst() const
*** Error code 1

the function header differs from the definition in the header file

    3.Recompile the code, including the new code for the NumberToGuess
      class. What happens now? Explain.

system compiles properly because the signatures for both the header
and the definition file now match

    4.Try to recompile the code, including the new code for the
      NumberPair class. What error message do you get? Why? What do
      you think is happening?

mastermind.cpp: In function `int main(int, char**)':
mastermind.cpp:88: error: passing `const NumberPair' as `this' argument of `int 
   NumberPair::getFirst()' discards qualifiers
mastermind.cpp:91: error: passing `const NumberPair' as `this' argument of `int 
   NumberPair::getFirst()' discards qualifiers
*** Error code 1

the now-non-constant method is being utilized by another constant
method, so it throws up...

    5.Recompile the code, including the new code for the NumberPair
      class. What goes wrong now? Think about the fact that each class
      is compiled separately, and when a class is compiled, the only
      information has on its collaborators is stored in the header
      files included therein. There is a separate linking phase that
      packages all the compiled code into a program. With this in
      mind, try to explain the error message you see.

Undefined                       first referenced
 symbol                             in file
NumberPair::getSecond() const       mastermind.o
ld: fatal: Symbol referencing errors. No output written to mastermind
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
*** Error code 1

other classes are expecting to be able to use the method, but without 
the method being defined, crashing occurs when it doesnt know what to do
