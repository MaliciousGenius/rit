Programs to test</h1>

<div class="MsoNormal">Following are descriptions of some simplified utilities.
Read the specification carefully and then devise a set of tests to test
conformance with the specifications. If the specification is incomplete,
point this out and include tests to verify program behavior in these unspecified
areas.</div>

<h2>
labcmp &lt;file1> &lt;file2></h2>

<h3>
Description</h3>

<div class="MsoNormal">The labcmp utility compares two files. If the files
are identical, labcmp will write a message to that effect on standard out.
If they differ, it writes to standard output a message containing the number
of lines that were the same. If one file is an initial subsequence of the
other, that fact is noted. If exactly two file names are not specified
on the command line a usage message is printed on standard output and the
program terminates.</div>

<h2>
labgrep &lt;searchString></h2>

<h3>
Description</h3>

<div class="MsoNormal">The labgrep utility reads standard input and copies
only lines that contains at least one occurance of the search string to
standard output. If no search string is specified or there are too many
arguments a usage message is printed on standard output and the program
terminates.</div>

<h2>
labsort &lt;column></h2>

<h3>
Description</h3>

<div class="MsoNormal">The sort command sorts lines of standard input and
writes the result on the standard output. The first character of a line
is in column 0. The sort key is the decimal value of the longest sequence
of digits in the line starting with the indicated column. If there is no
digit in the indicated column then the sort key is zero.
<br>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">For example, if the column number indicated in the
command line argument is 5, here are some sample lines with their resulting
keys:</div>

<center><table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" NOSAVE >
<tr>
<td><b>LINE</b></td>

<td><b>KEY</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>I am 72 years old today.</tt></td>

<td>72</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>I am only 72 years old today.</tt></td>

<td>0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>I'm 72 years old today.</tt></td>

<td>2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>123456789 that's all folks!</tt></td>

<td>6789</td>
</tr>
</table></center>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is a stable sort, i.e., the order of lines with
identical keys is not changed. If no column is specified or there are too
many arguments a usage message is printed on standard output and the program
terminates.
<h2>
labsum (sum a list of numbers modulo 10<sup>n</sup>)</h2>

<h3>
Description</h3>

<div class="MsoNormal">The labsum utility calculates and prints the last
n digits of the sum of the numbers read from standard input. A single argument
is expected on the command line which is the number of digits to accumulate.
If there is not exactly one command line argument specifying the number
of digits to print a usage message is printed on standard output and the
program terminates.</div>

<h2>
labtail (list the last n lines of a file)</h2>

<h3>
Description</h3>

<div class="MsoNormal">The labtail utility copies standard input to the
standard output beginning at the nth to to last line. Copying begins at
the nth to to last line and continues to the end of the input. Exactly
n lines will be copied to standard output. If there is not exactly one
command line argument specifying the number of lines to be output a usage
message is printed on standard output and the program terminates.</div>
