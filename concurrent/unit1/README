Automated Checkout System

Building

  The application can be built using the included Ant script.  The possible
  Ant targets include:

	- 'build' - Compile the Java source code into the 'bin/' directory.
	- 'dist' - Create an executable jar file 'Checkout.jar'

	- 'clean' - Remove the 'bin/' directory
	- 'dist-clean' - Remove the jar file

-------------------------

Execution

  Once a compiled version has been created, the executable takes a single
  command line parameter: the number of checkout lanes to manage.

    java Checkout <num_lanes>
    java -jar Checkout.jar <num_lanes>

  Once running, the application repeatedly requests pairs of input, starting
  with the lane number to target, and the action to send to the target. Actions
  understood by the lanes include:

	- 'scan <cost>'
	- 'done'
	- 'insert <amount>'
	- 'pay'
	- 'reset'
