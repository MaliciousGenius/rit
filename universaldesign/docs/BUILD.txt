* How to build the project *
----------------------------

1. Enter the QMake enviroment
--- Linux: open a terminal and 'cd' to the trunk folder
--- Windows: open a Qt QMake command prompt and 'cd' to the trunk folder

2. Run 'qmake' to build a Makefile
--- Only needs to be done once, unless the .pro file has changed

3. Run 'make' to build the project
--- If you can't get things to compile after a lot of changes, try running
      'make clean' first to remove previous object files, then run 'make'

4. Run the binary
--- You can find it in the 'bin' directory
